# 🍏 Apple Store Chatbot – AI Coursework Project

This project is an **NLP-driven Apple Store Chatbot** developed as part of my AI coursework.  
The system simulates an Apple Store assistant capable of responding to user queries about Apple products, services, and support.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The chatbot was built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** concepts and custom-trained models.  
Its primary functions include:

- Understanding user queries related to Apple devices  
- Responding using structured conversational flows  
- Extracting intent and matching responses based on OpenNLP models  
- Simulating basic customer-assistance workflows  

This project demonstrates core AI principles, including **dataset creation**, **model training**, and **dialog management**.
