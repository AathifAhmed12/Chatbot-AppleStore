#  Apple Store Chatbot – AI Coursework Project

This project is an **NLP-driven Apple Store Chatbot** developed as part of my AI coursework.  
The system simulates an Apple Store assistant capable of responding to user queries about Apple products, services, and support.

---

##  Project Overview

The chatbot was built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** concepts and custom-trained models.  
Its primary functions include:

- Understanding user queries related to Apple devices  
- Responding using structured conversational flows  
- Extracting intent and matching responses based on OpenNLP models  
- Simulating basic customer-assistance workflows  

This project demonstrates core AI principles, including **dataset creation**, **model training**, and **dialog management**.

##  System Architecture

The system consists of:

- **Dataset Module** – Contains training phrases and tag-intent mappings  
- **NLP Engine** – Built using OpenNLP for tokenization, sentence detection, and intent classification  
- **Conversation Handler** – Maps predicted intents to appropriate responses  
- **UI / CLI Interface** – Enables user interaction in a simple chat environment  
- **Documentation** – Includes architecture explanation, model behavior, and workflow diagram

##  Technologies Used

- **Java**  
- **OpenNLP** (Tokenization, Sentence Detection, Classification)  
- **Custom dataset preparation**  
- **Pattern matching & conversational logic**
